## Demo 1
###### Tuesday 9/1

#### Format
**Personal Introductions**  
Demo day will be an opportunity to showcase your work and yourselves. Each demo will start with team members giving a 1 min personal pitch about themselves and their background. *Where are you from? What were you doing before Access Code? Why are you interested in tech and mobile development? What do you plan to do following the program?*

Check out the last year's demo day to [see examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS35Lxv6WRM) of personal pitches.
