# unit-3-project  

### Access Code 2.1 Final Project  
The goal of this final project is to utilize the technical and product skills you’ve been gathering over the last 5 months to build a custom app with your teammates and showcase your abilities. 

You’ll be asked to form teams and propose a product of your own design. We will review all project proposals to ensure that each app meets the guidelines outlined below. We want to ensure that products are: 
  *  Solving a relevant problem that serves an existing market
  *  Technically complex and ambitious enough to highlight the skills you have gained
  *  Fully functional and polished for presentation at Demo Day  

With that in mind, things to think about when ideating projects are the **technical complexity**, **design**, and **product**..  

### Guidelines  
  *  Team Size: 3-4
  *  Team Formation:
    1.  Research  
    2.  Pitch  
    3.  Mingle  
    4.  Form Teams  
  *  Support: 
    *  Weekly technical office hours
    *  Weekly product office hours
  *  Process:
    *  6-Week Release Cycle
      - Week 0: Planning + [Proposal](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-3-project/blob/master/deliverables/ProposalTemplate.md)  
      - Week 1-3: Building
      - Week 4-5: Testing + Modifications
    *  Daily Standup @Class
    *  Weekly Retro @Sunday Class

### Project Requirements  
*  Overall product requirements
  - Technically complex
  - Compelling use case
  - Polished implementation (UI/UX)
  - Original product 
  - Proper release to Play
  - An engaging pitch that connects with the audience
*  Basic technical requirements 
  - Does not crash
  - Does not hang (little or no delay visible to the user)
  - Does not fail when internet connection is slow/unavaialable
  - Have a consistent look and feel visually across the app
  - Consistent with [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) guidelines
  - Look great in both landscape and portrait
  - Have well-organized, high-quality code
    -  Clean coding style (see this sample [style guide](http://www.javaranch.com/style.jsp) and the [Android project’s official guide](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html))
    -  Well-commented source code [some tips](http://blog.codinghorror.com/code-tells-you-how-comments-tell-you-why/)
    -  Clearly named files, classes, and methods (can I tell what each thing does?)
    -  Object-Orientation (think back to your [OOP lessons and exercise](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-1/blob/master/homework/week-0.md))
    -  Separation of Concerns ([Wikipedia description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns), [Reasons for Doing that](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/32614))
    -  Proper Access Modifiers on Objects (see the [official Java docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html))
    -  Drawables, Raw Media, Layouts, Activities, Fragments, etc are all in the proper places (read Android’s [descriptions of app structure](https://developer.android.com/intl/ru/tools/projects/index.html))

### Tips & Ideas
*  Things that would impress:
  - Super cool library that other devs could use
  - Integration of complex APIs (e.g video, web services, etc...)
  - Awesome UI
  - Work with the OS in a more intimate way (ie [Twilight App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.lux&hl=en))
  - Advanced Separation of Concerns ([MVP/MVC-style architecture](http://fernandocejas.com/2014/09/03/architecting-android-the-clean-way/))
*  Things to Avoid:
  -  Unusable: Good technical implementation, but does not consider the end user's interaction
  -  Non-function: Good UI, but does not actually incorporate the tools needed to be feature complete.
  -  Obvious: Solution can easily be found in tutorials or examples, copies an existing system tool, or simply strings together APIs.
  -  Not Useful: This app doesn’t have a clear purpose or solve a problem. 
*  Some sample project ideas:
  -  Weather + Calendar
  -  Poll app / trivia app 
  -  Really good photo journal app
  -  Really good note taking app
